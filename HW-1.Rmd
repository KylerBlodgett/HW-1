## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Christian, Paul, Joy, Delaney, Prof. Kim
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 11 hours 
* What gave you the most trouble: Avoiding the "Alabama First" problem, as it came up in problems 1 and 3. Also, plotting the vertical mean line (like from Lec07 kid.iq graphics) in question 2 gave me a problem. 
* Any comments you have: Feeling better about this all each time I sit down to work on it, so here's to continued progress! 





## Question 1:

* Plot a "time series" of the proportion of flights that were delayed by > 30 minutes on each day.  i.e.
    + the x-axis should be some notion of time
    + the y-axis should be the proportion.
* Which seasons did we tend to see the most and least delays of > 30 minutes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#Part 1
flights2 <- 
  group_by(flights, date) %>%
  tally() %>%
  rename(num_flights = n)

flights_mod <-
  filter(flights, dep_delay>30) %>%
  #mutate(date=day(date))%>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  tally() %>%
  rename(num_flights_late = n)

flights_compiled <-
  left_join(flights2, flights_mod, by="date") %>%
  mutate(prop_late = num_flights_late / num_flights) %>%
  select(date, prop_late)
  
ggplot(data=flights_compiled, aes(x=date, y=prop_late)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(x= "Date", y= "Proportion of Flights Delayed by 30+ Min.") +
  ggtitle("Percent of Flights Delayed by Date")

#Part 2
flights_mod2 <-
  filter(flights, dep_delay>30) %>%
  mutate(date=months(date))%>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  tally() %>%
  rename(num_flights_late = n)

ggplot(data=flights_mod2, aes(x=date, y=num_flights_late)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(x= "Date, Months Alphabetical", y= "Flights Delayed by 30+ Min.") +
  ggtitle("Total Flights Delayed by Month")

```

In response to the second part of this question, we see from the bargraph "Total Flights Delayed by Month" that early spring and late summer (i.e., May, June, and July) had the most flights delayed by more than 30 minutes from Houston in 2011. In each of these months over 2200 such flights were delayed by 30 minutes. Contrarily, flights from Houston in autumn 2011 (i.e., September, October, and November) were least frequently delayed by more than 30 minutes. Each of these months logged fewer than 1500 flights delayed by over 30 minutes.



## Question 2:

Some people prefer flying on older planes.  Even though they aren't as nice,
they tend to have more room.  Which airlines should these people favor?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
old_planes <- (left_join(flights, planes, by = "plane") %>%
  select(plane, carrier, year) %>%
    distinct(plane) %>%
  arrange(carrier, year) %>%
  group_by(carrier, year) %>% 
  tally () %>%
  rename(num_in_year = n))

#ybar <- mean(old_planes$num_in_year)

ggplot(data=old_planes, aes(x = year, y = num_in_year)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  #geom_vline(xintercept=ybar, col="red", size=1) +
  facet_wrap(~carrier, nrow=4) +
  labs(x = "Year of Plane Construction", y = "Total Planes Constructed")
  ggtitle("Age of Planes by Airline") 
```

From these graphs, we can see visually that the American Airlines (AA) used the oldest planes  in their departures from the Dallas airport during January 2011. Delta Air Lines (DL) also has fairly old fleets for that time window, as the only other airline with several planes made before 1980. All other carriers have planes manufactured predominantly since the mid- to late-1980s.


## Question 3:

* What states did listed Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?
* What states did all Southwest Airlines flights tend to fly to?


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
#Part A - Only flight patterns

WN_flights2 <- 
  left_join(flights, airports, by=c("dest"="iata")) %>%
  filter(carrier == "WN") %>%
  distinct(dest) %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  tally() %>%
  rename(flights_to_state = n)

ggplot(data=WN_flights2, aes(x = state, y= flights_to_state)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x= "State", y= "Total Flights") +
  ggtitle("Unique Southwest Flights by State")
  
#Part B - All flights

WN_flights <- 
  left_join(flights, airports, by=c("dest"="iata")) %>%
  filter(carrier == "WN") %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  tally() %>%
  rename(num_WN_flights = n) %>%
  mutate(num_WN_flights = num_WN_flights)

ggplot(data=WN_flights, aes(x = state, y= num_WN_flights)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  labs(x= "State", y= "Total Flights")
  ggtitle("All Southwest Flights by State")
```

If we only consider unique flights patterns in the first part of this question, we find that Southwest Airlines tended to fly to Texas (7 unique patterns), Florida (4 patterns), and California (3 patterns) from Houston in 2011. All others of the 20 states flown to by Southwest had either two or one unique flights. 

For the second part of this question we consider all Southwest flights, including duplicate flights to the same destination. Texas was naturally the most popular state destination from Houston by a factor of over 4 times the flight volume to the second most popular state (Florida). In decreasing order, Florida, Louisiana and California were the next most popular destinations for Southwest passengers from Houston in 2011. 


## Question 4:

What weather patterns are associated with the biggest departure delays?

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
weather_effect <- 
  left_join(flights, weather, by=c("date", "hour")) %>%
  select(date, hour, dep_delay, conditions) %>%
  group_by(conditions) %>%
  summarise("mean_dep_delay" = mean(dep_delay)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_dep_delay))

kable(head(weather_effect), format = "markdown")
```

We consider only weather conditions in this question, leaving factors like wind speed, temperature, visibility, etc. to the side for now. The chart above shows only the six weather conditions associated with the highest average deaprture delays. We see that in Freezing Rain conditions, travelers experience an average departure delay of 219 minutes, followed by Light Freezing Rain which delays departures by an average of 78 minutes. 
This answer is helpful to travelers analysing weather's effect on Houston flights, but some holes remain. For example, if this question intends to get at weather conditions associated with absolute biggest delays - rather than the average method used here - the most impactful weather conditions may be different. Even so, this analysis is helpful for answer the question of the conditions associated with the largest average departure delay. 

## Question 5:

I want to know what proportionately regions (NE, south, west, midwest) each 
carrier flies to from Houston in the month of July.  Consider the `month()`
function from the `lubridate` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
state_by_region <-
  left_join(airports, states, by="state")

july_flights <-
  left_join(flights, state_by_region, by=c("dest"="iata")) %>%
  select(date, carrier, state, region) %>%
  mutate(date=months(date))%>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  filter(date=="July") %>%
  group_by(carrier, region) %>%
  tally() %>%
  rename(region_dest = n)

ggplot(data=july_flights, aes(x=region, y=region_dest)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap(~carrier) +
  labs(x= "Region", y= "Total Flights") + 
  ggtitle("Regional Flight Destinations from Houston by Carrier (2011)")
```

From these graphics we can see the distribution of flights by carrier that left the Houston in July 2011, according to their regional destination. Naturally, flights to the southern region of the United States, though this is not universal among the airlines. The four regions - midwest, northeast (NE), south, and west - are defined by the given "states_by_region" data frame.
